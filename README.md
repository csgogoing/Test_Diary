# Test_Diary
This repository record my experience and daily thoughts of test-work

  I have been working as a tester for  for several month, and recently a thought come up to my mind when i was
kind of in charge of the counter project that maybe i can write down my lessons learnt form daily-work.
  And thats how this diary thing come up.Recording my mistakes and suggestions for my test work will definitely 
benefit my teststing skils in my perspection.
  So hope i could insist on this thought.
